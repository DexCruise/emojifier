# emojifier

##Classes overview:

###GUI:

 - a swing app that makes using the core functionality possible

###CLI:

 - a command-line interface for the core functionality. I would not recommend you use this, as there is more functionality in the GUI version

###Emojifier

 - replaces each of a string's characters with entries of the hashmap fed to it

###EmojifyWrapper

 - creates a hashmap for emoji markdown and lets the GUI and CLI interface with it
